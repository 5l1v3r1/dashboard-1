Frage:
1. What does data mean to the different people in the organization? (Was sind die Erfahrungen, die die Menschen mit Daten haben?)

Antworten:
a. tracking situational or domain awareness in the city and respond appropriately with public service delivery, emergency services delivery, etc.
b. plugging in their daily hours into a time card.
c. thinking about how to change policy or how to make a different decision from an executive office and wanting to do some analysis to inform their thinking. They tended to use Excel, make some charts and tables, create reports, and then advocate for their position with their colleagues and bosses.
d. tracking the success and failures of the departments and the city itself. They tend to get, which is what I saw firsthand, these long reports, 15, 20, 30 pages full of charts, graphs, text, every quarter and use those to help decide what’s the next strategic direction.

Folgerung: 
There are effectively three kinds of civic or public data that need to be collected, aggregated and summarized for effective decision making:
1. Transactional or operational / Raw Data
It’s what’s happening on-the-ground, all the time. That needs to surfaced up, organized, and then presented in a compelling way for a decision maker to say, “We need to do something different about that.”
2. Performance metrics
KPIs. In contrast to transactional data, this is aggregate. This gets more complicated than transactional data, because it’s not usually reported through just one system. Thus, systems integration and aggregation are essential, but immensely difficult. Tracking performance metrics is hard. Made further difficult by their normative nature.
3. Quality of Life
How are things going in the city, and more directly, how do people feel about it? How do you feel people feel about their government? That’s the ultimate barometer of our success.

Bedürfnis:
Gathering 'quality of life' data, and then combining it with performance metrics and operational data is critical. Insight might be generated at this sweet spot, the alignment of transactions, performance, and quality of life - that’s the ideal function of data science and dashboarding.

What to do:
Figure out that sweet spot, that correlation, that causation, that’s profoundly interesting and useful, but that’s really hard to do. It is the work we have to do as civic data advocates and as data-driven public officials. Data isn’t just data. It’s more complicated than that. Different kinds and different types. Different types that interact, interrelate, and connect, and it is our responsibility as public stewards to bring them together to help better serve citizens.
